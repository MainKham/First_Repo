In our rapidly advancing world, new trends emerge and fade away quickly. We can see the world through a small screen after the Internet was introduced not very long ago. People have come to choose to stay at home and use the Internet as it is easier to access almost anything a person can think of. So, he might be watching his favorite show or live sports on his cozy sofa rather than being in a congested crowd. However, there is a significant withdrawal from using the Internet. As it is easily accessible to every place and breaking news or most importantly trending flows in the world, people have become addicted to it. So, I am going to discuss the pros and cons of using the Internet in this essay. 



//Trolls, Bullying, and Stalkers: The internetâ€™s anonymity allows trolls and abusive individuals to thrive. Cyberbullying is a growing issue, especially among young people. Stalkers can exploit personal information shared online.
Exposure to Harmful Content: While the internet offers valuable resources, it also exposes users to violent, pornographic, or undesirable material unintentionally.
Addiction and Distractions: Excessive internet use can lead to addiction, wasting valuable time on non-productive activities. Workplace productivity may suffer as well.
Never Truly Disconnecting: The internet enables remote work, but it also means being perpetually available, even outside agreed-upon work hours.
Crime, Identity Theft, and Hacking: Hackers can steal personal information, leading to identity theft. Hidden corners of the internet facilitate criminal activities.
Cheating and Exploitation: Students can cheat on their studies, and the internet enables exploitation in various forms.
